## The Joint Issue Tracker - A Halo Community initiative to improve the state of issue tracking.

Currently discussion of toolkit bugs is largely confined to Discord or forums which are difficult to search and do not function well as issue trackers.
We aim to change that by utilizing Github Issues to enable community reporting and discussion of bugs & workarounds.
